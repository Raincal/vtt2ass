Dialogue: 00:20:43.26,00:20:43.27,so let's let's compare the two\n 
Dialogue: 00:20:43.27,00:20:48.87,so let's let's compare the two\napproaches so on the Left we have a
Dialogue: 00:20:48.87,00:20:48.88,approaches so on the Left we have a\n 
Dialogue: 00:20:48.88,00:20:51.45,approaches so on the Left we have a\nfamiliar class component this state has
Dialogue: 00:20:51.45,00:20:51.46,familiar class component this state has\n 
Dialogue: 00:20:51.46,00:20:54.93,familiar class component this state has\nto be an object we bind some event

Dialogue: 00:20:54.94,00:20:56.91,to be an object we bind some event\nhandlers so that we can access this
Dialogue: 00:20:56.91,00:20:56.92,handlers so that we can access this\n 
Dialogue: 00:20:56.92,00:20:59.85,handlers so that we can access this\ninside the event handler for this that's

Dialogue: 00:21:02.92,00:21:04.77,a state when we call says state it\nactually doesn't just set the state that
Dialogue: 00:21:04.77,00:21:04.78,actually doesn't just set the state that\n 
Dialogue: 00:21:04.78,00:21:08.43,actually doesn't just set the state that\nmerges the state are the argument into

Dialogue: 00:21:08.44,00:21:10.74,merges the state are the argument into\nthe state object and then when we want
Dialogue: 00:21:10.74,00:21:10.75,the state object and then when we want\n 
Dialogue: 00:21:10.75,00:21:12.87,the state object and then when we want\nto access the state which it is that
Dialogue: 00:21:12.87,00:21:12.88,to access the state which it is that\n 
Dialogue: 00:21:12.88,00:21:16.11,to access the state which it is that\nstate and that's something so in the
Dialogue: 00:21:16.11,00:21:16.12,state and that's something so in the\n 
Dialogue: 00:21:16.12,00:21:19.11,state and that's something so in the\nexample on the right we don't need to
Dialogue: 00:21:19.11,00:21:19.12,example on the right we don't need to\n 
Dialogue: 00:21:19.12,00:21:21.71,example on the right we don't need to\naccess this that stayed at something

Dialogue: 00:21:21.72,00:21:24.09,access this that stayed at something\nbecause the name state variable is
Dialogue: 00:21:24.09,00:21:24.10,because the name state variable is\n 
Dialogue: 00:21:24.10,00:21:26.25,because the name state variable is\nalready available in the function it's

Dialogue: 00:21:31.30,00:21:35.07,need to set the state we don't need to\naccess this that's something because the

Dialogue: 00:21:35.08,00:21:36.99,access this that's something because the\nfunction that lets has said the name is
